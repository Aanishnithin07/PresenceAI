**#PresenceAI - AI-Powered Interview Coach ðŸ¤–#**

An AI-powered web application that serves as a personal interview coach. PresenceAI generates domain-specific questions, records your practice sessions, and provides real-time, data-driven feedback on your verbal and non-verbal communication skills.

(Recommended: Add a GIF of your application in action here. A tool like Giphy Capture can create this easily.)

About The Project
PresenceAI is designed to help users build confidence and improve their interview performance. Unlike generic practice tools, it leverages a Large Language Model (Google's Gemini) to create relevant questions for any job role, from "Software Engineer" to "HR Manager." After the user records their answers, the application uses computer vision and speech recognition to analyze their performance, providing a detailed feedback report.
